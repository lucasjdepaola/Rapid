# Rapid
My own text editor, which tackled the main benefits I've gotten out of vim, such as states, motions, bracket/brace/quote completion, command line, and search, with new added features such as backgrounds, cross-platform browser, and soon to come a ~/rapidrc source mechanism

The main goal of this editor is to show that with under 1000 lines of code (around 900 at the time of writing this) it is possible to replicate the 300,000 LOC vim, keeping the best features, omitting the rest. I finished what I consider the main features of vim in roughly 3 days.
